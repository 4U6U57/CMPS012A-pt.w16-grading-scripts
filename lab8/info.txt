Sorry for sending this out late, but I also have finals to take care of. I tried
to grade easier on this one, but there were still a lot of submissions that did
not compile at all, which is unfortunate. I am setting a soft limit of midnight
on Saturday, March 19, in which to request a regrade. You can do this, as always,
by replying REGRADE in this email (all caps please). Note that, due to limited
time, if you send me something and your error was covered under the rubric, I
will not be as lenient as I was in the past. We reserve the right to take off
additional points if we catch mistakes, etc. Good luck on your future courses,
and I hope you have a good one week break from coding. lab6 is also almost done.
