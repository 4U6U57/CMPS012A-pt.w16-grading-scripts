If you are receiving this now, this means you turned in lab2 late. There is a
deduction on your submission, depending on what you negotiated with the
instructor.

As this was submitted in late, it follows the same regrade policy as lab8,
namely, all regrades will be considered more carefully than before. The late
deduction is non negotiable. Please submit your regrades as replies to this
email, with the word REGRADE in all caps.
